Generative AI - simplified principles

Be Explicit: If you don't give specific details, the AI will guess (often incorrectly).

Remove Clutter: Give the AI only the necessary information. Remove irrelevant background noise to prevent confusion.

Use Two Models: Don't rely on just one AI. Use two different ones (e.g., ChatGPT and Claude) to compare answers and catch errors.

You Are the Boss: You set the goal. The AI helps you get there, but it should never decide the direction or grade its own work.

No Secrets: Never put confidential, private, or sensitive company data into a public AI tool.

Don't Just Type: Use voice commands, upload images, or use screenshots if it helps explain your point faster than typing.

Think in Steps: Don't dump a huge problem at once. Break it down step-by-step, just like teaching a new employee.

Watch for Lies: AI hallucinates (makes things up) and forgets context. Always verify the output.

Ask for Improvements: Ask the AI to help you write better prompts or to critique its own answers.

Cross-Reference: Take an answer from one AI and ask another AI to critique or improve it.

The Golden Rule
AI is a Draft, Not the Truth: Treat every answer as a rough draft. It is your job to verify, edit, and finalize the work.
